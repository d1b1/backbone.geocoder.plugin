Status: Very Beta - Working on getting the POC code out and moving the view and collections into a plug. Currently the code 
sites in require.js module.

### Beta project to build a public for Backbone.js to provide a display and edit widget for the Google GeoCoder API.

This project and the initial code is a spin off of feature built into the formagg.io document editor. The objective is to 
provide a plugin to any backbone form or view that will use a standardized approach to rendering and geocoding 
locations. Drupal does this very well, providing a module that provides both display and edit elements. I have moved his out of the larger code base so that it can develop as a standalone plugin with its own setup configuration
settings and bb templates.
